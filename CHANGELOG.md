## [2.0.0] - WIP

This is the new major release of Radonis. It features React Streaming SSR support as well as lots of improvements.
See below for new features and breaking changes. Follow the [migration guide](https://radonis.vercel.app/migrating-to-v2) for an easier upgrade.

### Added
- Streaming SSR support by using `renderToPipeableStream` under the hood.
- `withErrorPages` method to the Radonis contract. This method allows adding custom error pages.
- `useAssetsManager`, `useManifestManager` and `useRenderer` hooks for directly accessing Radonis internals.
- `useFlushEffect` hook for integrating 3rd party libraries with React 18 and Suspense.
- Standalone URL builder exported as `UrlBuilder` from `@microeinhundert/radonis`.

### Changed

**General**
- **BREAKING:** Routes are now always identified by their route handler in the format `ControllerName.action`.
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `withTitle` on the Radonis contract to `withHeadTitle`.
- **BREAKING:** Moved the head options on the third argument of the `render` method to a `head` subproperty.
- **BREAKING:** To better align with the model of optional hydration, the `Form` component now reloads the page by default. Use the `noReload` prop to opt out and use fetch instead. The `reloadDocument` prop was removed.
- Updated dependencies.
- Improved documentation.

**Hydration**
- **BREAKING:** Components must now be explicitly marked as hydratable by wrapping them with the new `hydratable` function exported from `@microeinhundert/radonis`.
- **BREAKING:** The `HydrationRoot` component is now exported from `@microeinhundert/radonis`.
- **BREAKING:** The component identifier is no longer required to be passed to the `HydrationRoot` component.
- HydrationRoots now ignored when used client-side.
- Changed how hydration works under the hood.

**Hooks**
- **BREAKING:** All hooks are now exported from the `@microeinhundert/radonis` package.
- **BREAKING:** Renamed the `useAdonis` hook to `useServer`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed the `useHead` hook. The head must now be set from inside the controller. This is because modifying the head while rendering makes streaming unnecessarily hard, as the head will not be available until rendering finished.
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `root` on the `useHydration` hook to `id`. 
- **BREAKING:** Removed `component` and `propsHash` from the `useHydration` hook. These properties are now available by combining `useHydration` with the new `hydration` property on the `useManifest` hook.

**Plugins**
- **BREAKING:** Deprecated the `twind` plugin in favor of the more streaming friendly `unocss`.

**Plugin API**
- **BREAKING:** The `afterRender` plugin hook now only gets passed one chunk of the rendered HTML instead of the whole document. The hook is now called once for every chunk of rendered HTML.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `beforeOutputAsset` plugin hook.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `afterOutputAssets` plugin hook.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `onScanAsset` plugin hook.
- The `beforeRender` plugin hook now gets passed an object with `ctx`, `props` and `manifest` attributes.
- The `afterRender` plugin hook now gets passed an object with an `ctx` attribute.
- The `beforeRequest` and `afterRequest` plugin hooks now get passed an object with an `ctx` attribute.

### Changed
- Updated dependencies.

- Built client bundle not written to disk.

## [1.10.0] - 2022-09-22

## Migration

Run `node ace generate:manifest` once after the upgrade and delete the `tmp/radonis` directory. 
Run `node ace generate:types` manually or don't use the generated types until the generation works better.

    "build:client": "node ace build:client --production",
  },
}
