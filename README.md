# Radonis

Easily bridge the gap between your [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) backend.
Get DX similar to [Remix](https://remix.run/) while having the power of a full MVC framework at your fingertips.

## Notable features

- Renders React views directly from AdonisJS routes and controllers.
- Partially hydrates only the components that require interactivity on the client (Islands Architecture).
- Includes pre-made hooks for working with AdonisJS inside your React views, both on client and server.
- Ships with a compiler powered by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), no Webpack Encore required.
